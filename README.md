# Classical Machine Learning Series | Cheapter 1 | TF - IDF 
I has initiated a comprehensive series focused on classic machine learning topics. This series will cover various machine learning algorithms and techniques through detailed reports and practical applications. Each chapter in the series will delve into a specific topic, providing both theoretical insights and hands-on examples.

## Chapter 1: TF-IDF
One chapter in this series is dedicated to TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency). This chapter includes:

Report: An explanation of the TF-IDF technique, its mathematical foundations, and its importance in text mining and natural language processing.
Application: A practical implementation using e-commerce data to demonstrate how TF-IDF can be used to analyze and extract meaningful insights from textual data.
